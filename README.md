# Fork It

Inspired by the long-closed [GitHub 2012 Game Off](https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off), that won't run in a browser.

Branch early, merge often! Branch to avoid bugs and merge back to master before you *release it* to ensure as you get as many commits in at the end as you can. But don't let those branches live too long!

Sort of visually and mechanically based on the GitHub [Network Graph](https://github.com/blog/39-say-hello-to-the-network-graph-visualizer) and [Contributions](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions).

### Requirements

* Microsoft.NET 4.5
* Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4
* F# 3.0

With a little effort you could get in up and running with MonoGame/Mono, Xamarin Studio etc.
